# RObust frequency-based Structure Extraction (ROSE)

## Introduction
ROSE is a method of finding structure in cluttered 2D maps using DFT. 
The approach relies on the idea that repeating structures in the map will have corresponding strong response in frequency spectrum.
Then through building a appropriate filter it is possible to suppress noise and clutter in the map.
